## One Ocean Exploration Zone

I volunteered at this exciting event held at Fort Adams for the Newport Stopover of the 2017-2018 Volvo Ocean Race. It was an excellent opportunity for education on ocean related topics. URI and GSO had multiple exhibits from a touch tank to live feeding corals. Visitors of all age enjoyed the touch tank and it was super fun to answer their myriad of questions!
