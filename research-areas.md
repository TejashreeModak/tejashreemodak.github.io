## Developing a new method for using both population genetics and epigenetics data together to inform population studies

DNA mutations are the best understood mechanisms to generate variation, but other, less well‚Äêstudied mechanisms such as DNA methylation exist and need to explored more. Especially considering the fact that these are influenced by environmental changes. This project aims at using a double digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) and epiRAD combined approach to look at genetic and epigenetic variance in populations. I have developed pipelines to analyze genetic and epigenetic data to identify SNPs and differential methylation in populations to test for variation and influence of environmental factors as well as geographic location on the variation.

## How does structural variation effect genome evolution?

Although presence of structural variation has been known since 1970s it is a highly understudied research topic. Recent advances have found links between copy number variation (CNV) and disease that has led to a surge of studies focusing on human structural variation. However most of the information we know is from a handful of models and mostly from humans. Comparative genomics can increase the breadth of our knowledge of structural variation. The goal of this project was to identify species specific novel mechanisms and rates of gene duplications, environmental influence on maintaining variation and their functional implications. I developed pipelines to assess copy number variation using whole genome sequencing data to obtain species specific CNV map.  Post doctoral Research Fellow at Schwartz Lab.

## What do we know about innate immunity? And what we need to explore more.

Organisms with no adaptive immunity live for hundreds of years. They rely on mechanisms of innate immunity that 	PhD candidate at Gomez-Chiarri Lab, URI. 

## Harnessing the power of Next Generation Sequencing to produce new genomes.

A sequenced genome can unlock a massive amount of research power. I have been part of two genome consortiums to sequence and develop genomes of non-model organisms as a scientific resource for comparative studies.    

## What can molecular DNA markers tell us about colonization history of Pacific islands?

The Pacific Ocean has a number of islands that are geographically isolated and as such make a great model to study island biogeography and understand how species colonized these islands. My focus was on the volcanic islands of American Samoa, Wallis and Futuna, Fiji, Tonga, and New Caledonia that vary in time of origin and age. I used mitochondrial DNA markers to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of several Samoan land bird species along with closely related taxa on neighboring islands. 
The need for new antibiotics and who can fit the bill. There are a handful of effective antibiotics and their rampant use has caused development of resistance in pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. Hospital-acquired infections are on the rise and the need for new antibiotics is urgent. I worked with Dr. Milind Watve to screen for novel antibiotic producing oligophilic Actinomycetes. Oigophilic Actinomycetes are commercially attractive due to their scare requirement of nutrients for growth. This can significantly reduce scale up and production costs for these antibiotic producers.
