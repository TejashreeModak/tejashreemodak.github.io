These blogs are reflective of the incessant Stackoverflow and Biostar searches that I have to go through as a part of my daily bioinformatics routine. As scientists we research and find the answers of the questions we donâ€™t know. Bioinformatics is no exception.  I learn as I go. The more I learn the more I do and the more fun it is! These blogs are a collection of things I found useful and put together as posts.
