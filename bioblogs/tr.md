## The `tr` Command in Linux

The `tr` (translate) command in Linux is used for **character transformation, deletion, and compression**. This is another useful sidekick for **fast command-line formatting of files**.

### Convert Lowercase to Uppercase (or Vice Versa)
Sometimes, gene names can be in capital letters in one file and lowercase in another or in mixed case. Use `tr` to **quickly convert to the same case** for easy downstream analysis:

```bash
echo "bioinformatics" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

```

### Remove Extra Spaces or Compress Repeated Characters
If a file has multiple spaces between words, compress them into a single space:

```bash
echo "This   is    an example" | tr -s ' '
```

`-s` (squeeze) removes consecutive duplicate characters, useful for cleaning messy text files.

### Remove Specific Characters (Delete Mode)
Remove all digits from a string:

```bash
echo "Gene123 Mutation45" | tr -d '0-9'
```

Useful for removing unwanted characters from dataset files.

### Replace One Character with Another
Replace colons (:) with tabs (\t) in a file:

```bash
cat file.txt | tr ':' '\t'
```
Converts :-delimited data to tab-separated format.

### Strip Newline Characters (Convert Multi-Line to One Line)
Convert multiple lines of a file into a single line (replace newlines with spaces):

```bash
cat file.txt | tr '\n' ' '
```

### Cleaning FASTA Headers for Downstream Analysis
Sometimes, FASTA headers contain spaces, special characters, or inconsistent formatting, which can cause issues with bioinformatics tools 

```bash
>Seq 1 Sample1|chr1
ACGTACGTACGT
>Seq 2 Sample3|chr1
TGCATTGCATTGCA
```

Problems with this format:

- **Spaces in headers** (`Seq 1 Human`) – Some tools don't handle spaces well.  
- **Pipes (`|`)** – Special characters might interfere with parsing.  


```bash
cat sequences.fasta | tr ' |' '_' > cleaned_sequences.fasta
```
`tr ' |' '_'`  Replaces spaces and pipes (|) with underscores (_)

**Now this ensures FASTA headers are clean for downstream tools!**

| Command           | Description                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'` | Convert lowercase to uppercase     |
| `tr -s ' '`      | Remove extra spaces               |
| `tr -d '0-9'`    | Remove digits                     |
| `tr ':' '\t'`    | Replace colons with tabs          |
| `tr '\n' ' '`    | Convert multi-line to single-line |
| `tr -cd '0-9'`   | Keep only numbers                 |
